welp...

i have decided to change webformers game progression because
i dont think that the current form of progression is fit
for the story i have planed. i have decided to remove the world map
this is to change story progression, next relese i hope to have another wave
of levels complete and also the level editor (maybe...)

webformer section 1 also will most likely finish in 2026
to be honest, with summer coming, i may attempt to recrute new devs
for level design and maybe begin a rough dev build of webformer section 2

thats all i have to say

sorry i havent done a progress report in a while, ive been busy with webformer
