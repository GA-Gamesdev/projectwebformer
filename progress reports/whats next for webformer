so, whats next for project webformer?

that is what i will be telling you today, project webformer is currently going through major renovations to its level system,
what has been done to the engine is still disclosed for the next beta release.
the level editor has not been shut down, but instead put on a temporary hold.

i plan to port webformer to:
pc
mac

in the next release.

also i plan to make the html file auto update
webformer's first section is geting closer to being finished
as a game.
